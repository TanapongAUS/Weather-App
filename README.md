# Weather Check Application by Tanapong Dechsakul

## Introduction
A weather application project that is developed from utilising React for frontend including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, and various APIS to design responsive web applications.

## Objective
A weather application that allows users to search for weather conditions based on their location (city name). The application can dynamically update its background and icons according to the current weather conditions.

## Features
### 1. Weather Check
Implement a search feature that allows users to enter a city location. Then, the system displays the current weather information for the selected location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy). However, providing the wrong city name may fail to search for the location and the system will display a message "Cannot find the location, please search again." which will ask the users to enter the city name again, due to the use of Open Weather API needs the users to enter the search term correctly.
### 2. Display Map
Implement a search feature that allows users to enter a city location. Then, the system displays the map of that location.
### 3. Display Dynamic Background
The application's background changes based on the day and night of that city location.
